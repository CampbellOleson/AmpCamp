                    <h3>The Best Fan Experience</h3>
                    <p>
                    Fans want to support the artists they love,
                    you just have to give them direct and
                    compelling ways to do so.
                     On Bandcamp, fans can listen to your music, decide if they like it, and if so,
                     pay you directly for it. They then get unlimited streaming access via the
                     free Bandcamp app for Android, iOS and Sonos, plus an optional high-quality download.

                    <h3>Dead-Simple Pre-orders</h3>
                    <p>
                    Setting up pre-orders on Bandcamp couldn’t be easier.
                    You can give fans one or more tracks immediately when they pre-order,
                     and then when you release your record, the full album appears instantly
                     in their collection in the Bandcamp app (we also notify your fans via email,
                       and provide a link to the high-quality download). And yep,
                       we automatically report your pre-sales to the respective music charts, too.
                       </p>

                    <h3>Search Engine Optimized</h3>
                    <p>
                    When fans Google your band name, track titles or lyrics,
                     they should find you, not lyriczzzbay.com or iMyFace.
                      Why should some other site get first crack at engaging,
                       and ultimately, profiting from, your fans? We grease
                        up your SEO slicker than pomade-dipped velour, so you
                         may claim your rightful place at the top of Google results.

                    <h3> Sell in (Just About) Any Currency</h3>
                    <p>
                    Price your goods in U.S. Dollars, Pounds Sterling,
                     Canadian Dollars, Euros, Australian Dollars, Israeli New Sheqels,
                      or any of 12 other currencies.

                    <h3>Real-time Statistics</h3>
                    Bandcamp’s rich, up-to-the-instant stats system reveals who’s linking to you,
                     where your music is embedded, which tracks are most and least popular,
                      what’s being purchased and when, which search terms and blogs are sending
                       fans your way, and what you ate for breakfast on January 4th, 1993
                       (Lucky Charms? That's a lot of sugar!). Use the data for the pure,
                        ego-stroking thrill of it all, or to jump in the conversation
                        and stoke the fires of your fandom.

                    <h3> Total Artist Control, Total Flexibility</h3>
                    Charge whatever price for your music you choose, and change it
                     whenever you like. Sell for a fixed price, specify a
                      minimum and let fans pay more if they want (and yes, they do pay more,
                        a whopping 50% of the time), or give your music away in exchange
                        for an email address. You retain complete control over your customer
                        information, just as you damn well should.

                    <h3> Physical and Digital, Side-by-Side</h3>
                    Bundle your digital music with your vinyl, posters, tickets,
                    t-shirts… you name it. For example, you can create an LP +
                     digital package and your fans get your music instantly --
                      no code redemption awkwardness, and no having to wait for the
                       physical record to arrive. Or sell tickets to your next show
                        with the digital of your latest album included (we’ll even
                           automatically generate your door list).

                    <h3>Please the Audiophiles</h3>
                    While many are content to stream your music, a vocal minority of
                    hardcore fans still demand high-quality download formats like FLAC
                    and Apple Lossless. We make it easy to keep them happy: you upload a
                     single lossless file (WAV, AIFF or FLAC) and we lovingly convert it
                      to every conceivable format under the sun.

                    We submit sales reports to SoundScan (North America), ARIA Charts
                     (Australia), OfficialCharts (UK), and The Official
                     New Zealand Music Charts each and every week, so go
                     ahead and set your sights on The Hot 100. American Idol
                      Redux, Season 47: The Album, watch out!

                    If you’re selling merchandise through Bandcamp,
                    we provide a streamlined fulfillment interface
                    from which you can see all your orders at a glance,
                     print shipping labels and packing slips, mark orders
                      as shipped and automatically notify the recipient,
                       or filter by package type, date, or shipped status.
                        You can even invite other members of your team to
                         use the fulfillment backend without granting them
                         access to the rest of your site (put those interns to work!).

                    Discounts codes let you... wait for it... offer fans discounts on

                       during checkout to apply the discount.
